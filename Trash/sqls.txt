sql-запрос который работает в ms sql server и не работает в access:
SELECT do.ID_Dish, o.Status, o.ID_Emp FROM Orders AS o JOIN (SELECT do.ID_Dish, do.ID_Order, do.Dish_Count, do.Ready_Count FROM Dishes_Order AS do ) AS do ON o.ID_Ord=do.ID_Order 
WHERE o.Status=1 AND do.Dish_Count!=do.Ready_Count AND o.ID_Emp=2

simple sql который не пашет в access
SELECT * FROM Orders AS o JOIN (SELECT * FROM Dishes_Order ) AS do ON o.ID_Ord=do.ID_Order 

адптируем нужный запрос под аксес:
SELECT do.ID_dish, do.dish_count, do.ready_count, d.Name_Dish FROM Orders AS o INNER JOIN (SELECT do.ID_Dish, do.ID_Order, do.Dish_Count, do.Ready_Count FROM Dishes_Order AS do ) AS do 
	ON o.ID_Ord=do.ID_Order INNER JOIN (SELECT d.Name_Dish, d.ID_Dish FROM Dishes AS d) AS d ON d.ID_Dish=do.ID_Dish
WHERE o.Status=1 AND do.Dish_Count<>do.Ready_Count AND o.ID_Emp=2
